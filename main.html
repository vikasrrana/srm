          <h1>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</h1>
          <p>We, as humans have an innate tendency to take 'reality' and 'perception' for granted. We never trouble ourselves to question what is 'real' to us, until we are faced by some problem or consequences. Normally humans would define what is real as what they perceive through the lens of belief and background, which differ from person-to-person. But don't you think that visualising things through this lens gives us a different picture of the world than what is the true 'reality'?
It is this reality which we want everyone to decipher. Not through any lens, but after critical analysis of what is presented to them. Because when we can see through all the barriers of social restrictions, we will be able to bring better and holistic solutions for the world.

            <h1>ABOUT TEDX</h1>
          <p>TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas worth Spreading, usually in the form of short, powerful talks (18 minutes or less) which can be described as “the ultimate brain spa”. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — in more than 100 languages.

TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 26 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives. At TED, the world’s leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes. Talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Benoit Mandelbrot, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Two major TED events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Long Beach, California (along with a parallel conference, TEDActive, in Palm Springs), and TEDGlobal is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.

TED’s media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily; the new TED Conversations, enabling broad conversations among TED fans; and the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers worldwide.

TED has established the annual TED Prize , where exceptional individuals with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx, which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world; and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
